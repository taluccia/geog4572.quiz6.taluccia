# Quiz 6: Vectorizing a Raster Image in Illustrator



# Objective: 



Using the material from [lecture 13](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog4572/tree/master/lectures/lec13), follow the directions given in section 2.2. Using the instructions, alter an image to remove the background of that image.



# Process:



I used the Image trace function to turn the raster image into a series of vectors. I then deleted the vectors that contributed to the image background. I regrouped the vectors and exported the image as both an svg and png.

# Product:



Included in the img folder of this repository are 3 files:

* apollo_org.jpg - this is the original image
* apollo_clip.png - this is the product of the above process
* apollo_svg.svg - this is the product of the above process, but saved as a svg file to be used in an html document.
